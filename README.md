Project Name: CLV_Value

Customer Lifetime Value & Retention Analysis using SQL

Project Overview
CLV_Value is a customer analytics project developed using the AdventureWorksDW2025 dataset.
The project focuses on analyzing customer value, purchasing behavior, and churn risk by transforming transactional sales data into meaningful business insights using SQL.

Key Analytics Covered

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV – Basic)
This analysis identifies each customer’s first and last purchase dates, calculates the total number of orders, and measures the customer’s lifetime duration in days.
It helps understand how long customers stay active and how frequently they purchase.

CLV Segmentation (High / Medium / Low)
Customers are segmented into High, Medium, and Low CLV groups based on total revenue contribution.
Revenue-based ranking is performed using NTILE to classify customers into relative value tiers.
This segmentation is useful for targeted marketing and prioritizing high-value customers.

Churn Risk Analysis (Inactive Customers)
This analysis identifies customers based on inactivity duration since their last purchase.
Customers are categorized as Active, At Risk, or Churned using predefined inactivity thresholds.
It helps businesses detect churn early and design re-engagement strategies.

Revenue per Customer per Lifetime Day
This metric calculates the average daily revenue generated by a customer across their lifetime.
It normalizes customer revenue by lifetime duration, allowing fair comparison between short-term and long-term customers.
